My personal dev tools setup and system dotfiles

Check out more on [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/).

## INSTALLATION
-----
1.  Clone locally and run `./install.sh`
2.  Sit back and enjoy.


## TODO
-----
-   Add more dev tool installation routines
-   Cleaner system checking to identify and source system-specific bash profile files (ie. the `sm` folder that isn't included in revision control here)
